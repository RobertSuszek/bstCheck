# bstCheck

Program runs in CMD and checks if a given tree is a BST.
The tree must be given in text file, in XML-like format. The example of input data is in test.txt file.

Program takes path of text file as -i parameter run in CMD. 
Example usage: SprawdzenieDrzewa -i myTreeFile.txt

Program prints "To jest BST" if given tree is a BST, or "Nie, to nie jest BST" is it isn't.

Program was developed as a project for one of my classes at SUoT.
